## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Passive & active subdomain enumeration
- âœ… DNS brute-forcing with custom wordlists
- âœ… DNSSEC NSEC zone walking
- âœ… Live host and port detection (httpx + nmap)
- âœ… Vulnerability scanning (nuclei)
- âœ… Subdomain takeover detection (subzy)
- âœ… Easy installation with tool checker
- âœ… Optional virtualenv setup for clean Python environment

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure
The dns_enum_toolkit/ directory contains the main Python script, installer, and requirements file for running DNS enumeration. The recon/ folder is automatically created per target domain to store all scan results.
```markdown


dns_enum_toolkit/
â”œâ”€â”€ dns_enum_toolkit.py       # Main Python script
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh                # One-click installer for all dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies (optional)
â””â”€â”€ recon/                    # Auto-created per domain (contains output)

```
## ðŸ“‚ How to make it Running 
```markdown

**Step 1: Before Running dns_enum.py first run the following to make the Pre-requisite ready**
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install

**Step 2: This sequence sets up a clean Python virtual environment and installs all required packages from requirements.txt without affecting system Python**
sudo apt install python3-venv -y
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Step 3: Run the Main File**
python3 dns_enum.py <url>

```
## ðŸ“¤ Output
```markdown
All recon data will be stored under:
recon/example.com/
â”œâ”€â”€ amass_passive.txt    # Passive subdomains from Amass
â”œâ”€â”€ amass_active.txt     # Active subdomains from Amass brute force
â”œâ”€â”€ all_subdomains.txt   # Combined and sorted subdomain list
â”œâ”€â”€ resolved.txt         # Resolved (live) subdomains via dnsx
â”œâ”€â”€ httpx.txt            # Live HTTP services and technologies
â”œâ”€â”€ nuclei.txt           # Vulnerability scan results from nuclei
â”œâ”€â”€ nmap_scan.nmap       # Nmap scan results for open ports
â”œâ”€â”€ dnsenum_report.xml   # XML output from dnsenum
â”œâ”€â”€ dnsrecon_output.xml  # XML output from dnsrecon
â””â”€â”€ theHarvester_example.html   # HTML report from theHarvester

```
